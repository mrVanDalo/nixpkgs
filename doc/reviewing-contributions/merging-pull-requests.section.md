# Merging pull requests

It is possible for community members that have enough
knowledge and experience on a special topic to contribute
by merging pull requests.

TODO: add the procedure to request merging rights.

<!--
The following paragraph about how to deal with unactive contributors is just a
proposition and should be modified to what the community agrees to be the right
policy.

<para>Please note that contributors with commit rights unactive for more than
  three months will have their commit rights revoked.</para>

In a case a contributor definitively leaves the Nix community,
they should create an issue or post on
[Discourse](https://discourse.nixos.org)
with references of packages and modules they maintain so the
maintainership can be taken over by other contributors.
